In the pybank challenge the goal of this project was to write a python script that would analyze financial records. The financial records include the profit/losses for specific months of a year. The scrip that was created obtained the total amount of months of financial records, the net profit/losses, the average change in profit/losses fro each month, the month with the  greatest increase in profits and the month with the greatest loss in profit.



Pypoll:

In the pypoll challenge the goal of the project was to help a small rural town count its votes for a political race but in a more modernized way. To achieve that i wrote them a python script that would loop through the data to count the voters so they wouldnt have to count them all by hand the old fashioned way.
